#Kernel 4.14 for BananaPi R2

##HowTo compile kernel:

 - checkout main branch
 - run "./build.sh importconfig" to import my config for bpi-r2
 - run "./build.sh config" to configure the kernel (menuconfig)
 - run "./build.sh" to start building kernel

Internal Wifi-driver (MT6625L) included

To use it:

  copy firmware and tools to SD-Card from https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-R2-bsp/tree/master/vendor/mediatek/connectivity or folder "utils"

  make a clean boot of bpi-r2
  remove wpasupplicant if installed: "apt-get remove wpasupplicant"
  run the following commands:
    wmt_loader
    stp_uart_launcher -p /etc/firmware &
    echo A >/dev/wmtWifi #(activate AP-Mode)

  if you type "ip a" you should see a ap0-device
  now you can add an IP-address, start a dhcp-server and start hostapd on it
